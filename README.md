# Life Expectancy Prediction

A Python-based machine learning project that predicts life expectancy based on socio-economic, health, and demographic factors.

## 🧠 Project Summary
This project explores a dataset containing health and demographic data from countries around the world. It applies regression techniques to predict life expectancy and identifies key features that influence it.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Linear Regression and evaluation using MAE & R²
- Data visualization for insights and predictions

## 📈 Results
- The model achieved reasonable accuracy, with MAE and R² scores indicating effective generalization on unseen data.
